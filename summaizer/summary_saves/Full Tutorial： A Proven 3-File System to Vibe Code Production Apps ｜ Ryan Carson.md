 Imagine that you had a very smart engineer show up on your doorstep. They have no context, no background. You wouldn't just tell random new employee, make me a game that's super fun to play, and then expect them to succeed. This isn't rocket science, but I think the reason why this GitHub repo has like 4,000 stars is because folks do want a process to follow to give them better results. I wouldn't want AI to run off and create 30 tasks. I would want it to create a high level, you know, give me five tasks and then I want to approve those. Let's talk about your three-part system and also how is it different from a typical vibe coding. So I'm going to walk you through a little bit how it works. Okay, welcome everyone. My guest today is Ryan. Ryan is a serial founder whose building is next star of solo by talking to AI for a few hours every night. And Ryan has an awesome three-part system for coding with AI that I'm really excited game to demo. And we'll also talk about what's like building an AI star as a solo founder. So welcome Ryan. Awesome, it's so fun to be here. I like the description of coding for hours at night. That feels like it's everybody. So that's me looking forward to chatting and sharing some stuff I've learned. Yeah, I don't know if you're a parent, but like, you know, yeah, I only have time to code a night. Exactly. Yeah, that's the best. Yeah. So the best time is either late at night or in the morning. But as you know, the problem is if you're going to like one and the nick gets to be two, then you're like, oh, man, I'm going to pay for this tomorrow. So you have to cut it off at a certain point. Yeah, let's get right into it. Let's talk about your three-part system and maybe can share what's like and also how is it different from a typical vibe coding. Yeah, sure. So let me give people some context. So they understand a little bit more about how I got here and kind of my skillset. So graduated from a Colorado State Computer Science degree in hand and got my first job as a web developer. So I learned mostly reading a Riley books. So there's probably some fans out there that love a Riley. And you know, read PHP cookbooks and started building. So then fast forward, I thought, OK, what's a problem that I care about? And I realized you need to send large files that you couldn't email. So I basically built Dropbox. It was called Dropsend built in myself. We racked our own servers. And that was acquired, I think, after two years. So that was kind of my first startup when it was really solo-founded. It was a BDC product. But it was exciting. And then I realized, you know what? I really want to scale this and empower more people. So we built them online school teaching code. So that's where Treehouse was born. We ended up raising B.C. scaling's team to over 100 people. And we ended up teaching about a million people how to code. So then I was just coding, coding, coding for hours and hours and hours at night. And my wife is like, please come to bed at some point. So if I share my screen, I can show you what is this that we're talking about. OK, so let me show you the actual GitHub repotes open source. So please use it. And I'll walk you through the three files as we go. Here's it. So we basically have three files. So a create PRD file. We have a generate tasks file. And then we have a process task list file. And these are just prompts, right? So I'm going to show you the first one that you would use. Now let me explain how you would use this really quick. So what is probably going to happen is you'll be using your agent and you'll have an idea for a feature that you want to use. And then you'll talk about that feature and then you'll tag this file. So I'm just going to show it to you. And then I'll probably go over to an agent and show you how it might work. So if we read through a little bit, the goal is to guide an AI assistant in creating a detailed PRD in Markdown. And the process is pretty simple, right? So it's a four step process. You, the AI will receive the initial prompt. The agent will then ask clarifying questions. And then it will generate the PRD. And then it will save the PRD as a Markdown file. We gave it some example clarifying questions it might ask about the problem of the goal, the target user, et cetera. And then we talked a little bit about the PRD structure, the target audience, and the output. Yeah, the clarifying questions is like pretty important. Because I become so lazy, like pumping AI. I just, hey, go build this like a movie app for me. I'll go build that. This is forcing me to actually provide some more details. Yeah. Well, because one thing I like to say to everybody is that, imagine that you had a very smart engineer show up on your doorstep, right? They have no context. They have no background. And you wouldn't just tell random new employee, make me a game that's super fun to play. And then expect them to succeed. Or they'll get any two more. So let's actually show you this in action. Let me switch over to ghosty. OK, so I'm going to take you over to my terminal to actually show you this in action. So I'm a big fan of ghosty. So if you're on a Mac and you have to use a terminal, I would totally recommend ghosty. It's amazing. And then I use T-MUX as my pain management. Again, you might be using an IDE, which is absolutely fine. But I've kind of fallen in love with this kind of bare metal approach. So on the right, I have one pain, which I'm going to run AMP in. So we're going to go ahead one second. And again, my HHKB keyboard is giving right now. So we're going to do AMP. And we're going to run it with a special feature called 2E, because it's a beta feature, which is kind of cool. And then on the left, we're going to run NeoVam. So let's start that up. And we're going to go ahead and show you. So on our left, we've got our project. And I'm actually going to be using the actual repo from my startup. It's called Untangle. It's a next JS app. It's about 100,000 lines of tight ships. So it's a pretty decent repo. And then on the right, we've obviously got AMP, which is my agent of choice running on the command. So let's go ahead and think about a feature that we want to ship. So now Untangle is basically an app to help people through divorce. And the reason why is it's a real world problem that people have. Thankfully, I'm happily made, I've been made to my amazing wife for 21 years. But I have three sisters and more best friends. And about two, three years ago, unfortunately, my older sister went through a divorce. And it was pretty rough. And it was expensive and hard. And then unfortunately, a little bit later, my younger sister went through a divorce. And I just watched how hard it was. And I thought, you know what? I feel like helping people through that process, getting them through filling out all the forms, layering on a really smart, large language model on top, will save them a lot of lawyer fees, a lot of pain. It's not a lawyer, but it does a lot of things that should save you money. So that's the context. So I think what we're going to do is add a little feature when the user is onboarded to try to get a feel for, what's their relationship like with their partner? So what I'm going to do is go in here. And I'm also a big fan of Whisper Flow. So I talk most of my prompts. Me too, yeah. So I'm going to do that. So, okay, so I want to build a feature that's going to help us understand the way that the user is relating to their current partner. We want to try to figure out, are they on good terms? Are they not on good terms? Are they speaking? You know, what's that relationship like? And we'd like to score it from one to 10, one being it's terrible and 10 being that they're on good terms. Okay, so that is the feature, but my sort of, now we're going to do is tag the PRD. So let's see if I can remember what's called, create PRD. All right, so we're going to tag that. And we're going to let it run and rock and roll. And that's basically like a slash command, right? That you created like somewhere. No, that is literally just tagging the file to put it in context. Okay. So it's very simple, right? This is kind of why I built these as markdown prompts that you really kind of tagging in a prompt. So what we're seeing is some of the reasoning tokens and then now we're getting back an answer. I'm going to keep this kind of light, you know, normally I would go through it and respond to all these, but I'm actually just just to speed this up. I'm going to say, why don't you pick what you think is best for all these things? Okay, so AMP is going to run off and pick what it thinks is best of that. And then it will generate the PRD. So what's kind of happening here is this guided process. Now, do you need to do something like this when you're just shipping a quick fix? Of course not, right? But this is a really helpful way to get through. All right, I need a pretty chunky feature written. I want to plan, I want to get through it. And then I want to ship it. So right now it's going to think about that. And are you using like a sonnet? Or? Yeah, so one of the interesting things about AMP that actually I didn't like at first is there's no model selector. And I remember when I first tried to make, wait a minute, what model am I using and how is this working? And also where the accept or reject diffs, right? And what I learned is that AMP is super opinionated about choosing a certain model that's been highly optimized for the agent harness, right? Because everyone who's building with models knows, like every model is wildly different, right? And you can't really hot swap models. It just doesn't work. And so the team at AMP decided to go with Sonnet 4 as the primary driver for the main agent. And then in a minute, I'm going to show you this kind of a cool feature where you can ask the Oracle to help. And what that does is that's a tool call out to O3. And then you get a bit more reasoning. It's a little slower, but you get more thoughtful. And I tend to think of that as like, I want to go ask my senior engineer a question and then get their input on that. We also use Gemini Flash for some summarization tasks. So all right, so let's head back over here. Okay, so it's created the PRD. It's called PRD partner relationships assessment.md. And then what I'm going to do is we're going to tag the next file to generate these tasks. Let's have a quick look at this file. So we're going to, let's see, it's called PRD. PRD, there it is. We're actually going to, okay. So you can see pretty straightforward PRD. This feature will assess and score the current relationship dynamics, the goals, user stories, what else we got. A couple of open questions, success metric. So kind of what you'd expect out of a decent PRD. Yep. Okay, so now I'm going to switch my screen back. All right, so we're back on the get repot. And I'm going to show you our next file that we're going to tag, which is the generate tasks file. So we've got a great PRD. And now what we want to do is build out the specific atomic tasks that we want the agent to knock out. And again, this is a prompt that we're going to tag. So the goal is to guide an AI system creating a detailed step by step task list markdown. And it should guide a developer through implementation, right? So we want to mark down file. We want it to be in the task folder. We want to give this file name. So this is pretty straightforward. Again, you've got 10 steps that I want the AI to follow. Receive the PRD, analyze the PRD, assess current state. Phase one, it generates the parent task, right? So I wouldn't want the AI to run off and create, you know, 30 tasks. I would want it to create a high level, you know, give me five tasks. And then I want to approve those. And then then I want the detailed one. So that's what we're doing here, generating the parent tasks. Tell me user waiting for confirmation and then generating the sub tasks. Yeah. Yeah, I think the parent sub task is pretty important. Yeah, because nobody, it was just generally like 30 different tasks. Yeah. I think this is, and this will get better as the models get better, right? But right now, I think all of us that are building with this stuff realize you really do need to pay attention. Yeah, you have to read what agent says it's going to do and guide it. Now, if you're just yellowing and vibe coding and having fun, who cares? But, you know, I'm not a vibe coder. I think a lot of people watching this are not vibe coders. We're just engineers that need to build real stuff. And so this steps is super important. This is what the file will look like. So you've got relevant tasks. And this is just to keep in context for the agent, hey, what files are we working on so it can refer back to them? Some notes that it might need. And then these are the tasks. And the reason why I'm using dot notation on these tasks is so they can be atomic and understandable. So you've got one, 1.1, 1.2, etc. So pretty straightforward. So let's show it in action. I'm going to switch back. Okay. So we're back in Ghosty. And we're going to use this generate task file. So let's hop back over here. Couple of things that are kind of fun to note. Sonnet now has a lot more context right. So you've got at least 400k. Sometimes it's up to a million. Depending if you want to use that, it is more expensive though. This is how many lines we've changed. We've obviously added about 70 lines, which you can see over here. So let's go ahead and tag this. And I can actually, I'm going to tag both the PRD and the generate tasks. Generates. Tasts. There we go. So I'm just going to tag both of them so that the agent has both those things in the context. And I don't even really need to tell what to do because the generate task instructions all there. Kind of crank away on that. And we'll open back up our file so you can see what's going on. Yeah. Normally you'll probably review the PRD first and make sure you know, make some edits and then ask the generate task, right? You would. Yeah. I would generally read this PRD a little closer. Yeah. But just so you don't all get super bored watching this. Yeah. We're not going to read that too carefully. What's interesting is a lot of agents like AMP have to do now, right? So you can see on the bottom right it is building its own list of tasks. I have to say that, you know, whether it's cloud code or cursor CLI or AMP or really any agent, it's pretty standard now. I think they're all shipping with tasks now. You have to actually manage a little bit between the two, right? So you can see these high level tasks kind of make sense. But in a minute, I'm going to be asking it to execute these very detailed atomic tasks and not use its own task system. So let's have a see what it's doing. So it says, I've generated the high level task based on your requirements ready to generate. So I'm actually going to open this file. Let's switch over here. What's it called? It's called a task. There we go. All right. Hide this. All right. So we've got relevant files here. It's going to be looking at the schema because we're probably going to record these things. It's got the main relationship assessment questionnaire page. It's got a ZOD, validation schema, et cetera, and then a couple notes. And then the tasks. These are the most important things, right? So number one, database schema and data layer. Number two, assessment questionnaire UI. I'm a three score calculation logic. Number four, results display interpretation. And number five, AI recommendation system integration. I mean, that seems pretty good to me. If I wasn't recording a podcast, I probably would dive into this a little bit more. Yeah. I'm going to give it a little feedback though and say, I think, so I'm going to say, we need to create a branch first before we do all this. So go ahead and add that as the first step. So there's six total steps. I also want to make sure that, actually, never mind, we won't do that. So let me do this last little bit. You'll see when we generate the subtasks, we're actually going to make sure that we're writing tests. Okay. And the reasons you create a branch is just so you know, if something scores out, you can't just revert, right? Exactly. Yeah. So typically, you know, I'll create a branch for any feature I'm building. I'm actually part of the core AMP dev team as well. So we always commit, we always create PRs for everything we do so that they can be merged back in. So all right, it's saying great. You know, we're going to add a first step in over here. So let's go over here and refresh the file. And you can see we've got create feature branch. Okay. So now I'm going to show you, we're actually going to continue the process and say go. So you can see over here, it said perfect. Create the task list to include branch creation in step one with six total ready to generate subtasks. I'm going to say you bet. Let's go. So now AMP is going to go and crank out subtasks for each of those six parent tasks. Actually, no, I'm going to stop it. I'm going to show you something really quick that I want to do. I'm going to say, what do you so call on the Oracle to make sure we're not missing? Any larger parent tasks. I probably should have spoke that, but. So this is an example of I want to use a little bit more compute to really make sure I'm not missing anything obvious. So in AMP, like I said, this is a tool call to O3. So to use a little bit more reasoning, a little more expensive. And if you're on any other agent, you could obviously switch the model selector, you know, and then do this. But I kind of like the DX of just being able to sort of talk to a more senior engineer. So we can see right now it's consulting the Oracle. It's going to check out a couple things. This is obviously running on three. So it'll be a little bit slower to come back. It's like, yeah, it's going to probably going to check up. Is it going to look at all your files or just this? Well, not necessarily. So what it's doing is just using more intelligence. So what we're doing is using a slightly more heavy reasoning model. Yeah. And then saying, look at what we're doing, everything that's in context. It doesn't do a lot of tool calling. So I think this is what's kind of valuable. You're not going to get a lot of agentec behavior here. What you're doing is saying, I just want someone to double check what I'm doing. That's saying, OK, actually, we need to add a few more steps to that. So now, the other interesting thing about AMP that threw me off at first that people are probably noticing is there's no accepting diffs or rejecting diffs here, which I didn't like at first. But now I've actually learned to love it because it speeds me up. So let's go back over here and reload the file. Just to be realistic, I'm going to say, you know what? I don't think we need automated analytics. So I'm going to go back over here and say, I don't think we need analytics and documentation. So why don't you remove those and then we'll proceed. I'm just giving you a little more realistic back and forth here so that you can see what this might look like. So all right. Now that switched back to Sonnet4, right? So now we're using the main agent. So we're going to go over here. There we go. OK. So now we've got as high-level tasks. Now we need to go ahead and generate all the sub tasks. So let's go ahead and do that. It says perfect. Remove the analytics. Now we have a love of focus parents. Ready to generate. Go. So here we go. And again, this isn't rocket science. But I think the reason why this GitHub repo has like 4,000 stars is because folks do want a process to follow to give them better results. And the problem is that we have these amazing magic agents now that can do so much and they're so eager to help that you can say something. This could have been a one sentence prompt. And the agent would have got to work on it. But would it have been what we actually wanted? Would it have been guided probably not? Yeah. This process kind of helps it through. All right. So we've got our sub tasks. They look pretty good. For the testing piece, ideally you have testing on each step, right? So like, you know, at the end. Yes. Absolutely. So let's have a look at this. So create a feature branch. That's fine. We would expect that. Database schema and data layer. I think what we'd want to do is implement former state management and react to form, add form validation. I think we really, like you said, want to add testing at the end of each step. And as you know, so the reason why you have to really care about test driven development now is because it's the loop that the agent needs to actually know if it's doing things right, right? Yeah. And so the faster you can speed up that loop, the faster you can build, right? So I'm going to go in here and ask you to do that. So at the end of each step, I need you to add tests so that we understand if everything is working correctly. Let's use GEST please. All right. So we're going to. It's going to go ahead and modify those. So so Peter, you obviously doing the select. I talked to a lot of people. How are you seeing people using test, test driven development to really speed up their agent workflows? I mean, just including that line or including the plan is key because otherwise, if you're not doing this, then you're basically doing vibe coding. You're like, hey, this is not working. Go fix this. I can just go back and forth for like two hours. It's not working. It's still not working. No, it's still not working. So yeah. All right. So you can see. Let's go over here. Yeah. Yeah. So now we basically have GEST tests using types. And what is GEST? GEST is just a nice testing framework for for TypeScript and next JS. So it's a really handy way to quickly run your C i checks to to make sure everything is working correctly. Now, you could use all sorts of different frameworks, but I like GEST. So and it's probably because an agent suggested to me at some point. Okay. So we've gone through to kind of walk everyone through what we've done. So we had an idea for feature. What we did is we went into AMP and we spoke, you know, all the text of the feature and then we tagged the PRD generation prompt, had it generate the PRD. Then we took the PRD and we generated high level tasks. We edited those tasks and then we asked and then we used the generate tests prompt to then generate all the sub tasks. So that's where we're at. So we have a pretty detailed list of tasks here. You know, under each one of these, we've got six or seven pretty detailed tasks that are atomic. And then what we'll do now is we use the third one. Okay. So we are back at GitHub and what we're going to do is go to our third file, which is the process task list file. Now what this is doing is it's basically controlling how fast the agent can move. I've chosen to say do one sub task at a time and do not start it until I say yes or why. And then when you finish a sub task and really market complete with an X and then if all sub tasks underneath the parent are finished, then go ahead and first run the test suite. It's actually saying, hey, remember to do this. If all pass tests, then you can add it and then you can commit it. So ideas we're trying to create this behavior of code test and commit, right? In an iterative sort of basically software engineering best practices. Yeah. Exactly. This is how you should work if you are a software engineer. Yeah. This isn't rocket science or new. Like you said, this is basic software engineering behavior. So what we're going to do is head back over to ghosty and see how it works. All right. So we're back in ghosty with AMP. And on the left, we have our task that we want to accomplish. And we're actually going to say to the agent, let's get going. So I'm going to tag the process task list here. I'm going to tag that. And then I can actually just execute it because that's all the instructions in it. And then we'll start looking at it. It's saying, OK, I should only do one task at a time. It knows it should do 1.1. OK. So basically, we've been talking for like 20 minutes, right? And now it's finally starting to code. Yeah. Yeah. Isn't that wild? I mean, it's so different than, you know, yolowing kind of one prompt and then just seeing what happens. Now it's probably super boring to watch. And I'm sorry, but this is actually the way real software development happens with agents. So it's saying, should I proceed? And we'll say you bet. So yes, I can type correctly today. All right. So I've had, now everyone who's coded with the agent has different opinions on this. You know, do you go yellow mode and let it run any tool at once? Or do you have to ask permission? I generally say don't do any get commands without me approving. I do have my agent run or at least type all my get commands because it's just easier for me to remember them. So, all right, of course, we were already on main, but it's checking out just in case. And now it's going to create a feature branch partner relationship assessment. And then we're going to see it spin that up. And then you can see it marked it as complete, right? Yeah. Now, and again, this is where it's kind of nice for me not to accept all these diffs. Like it's just nice. Like I can see, okay, yeah, it changed 1.1 to check. I didn't have to approve it. So we're just kind of rocking. So should I proceed? We'll say yes. Okay. So I guess this third step of your system actually requires you to say here and watch it code because like, you know, normally I would go get a coffee or something like that. Yes. Yeah. And I think I may revise or this is open source. So someone should, you know, create a PR to revise this. I think, you know, when I shipped this, we were on Sonnet 37. And I think with Sonnet 4, you really don't need to hand hold it, you know, quite as tightly, which is kind of interesting. So we'll see it kind of crank through a couple tasks. Yeah. Hey, so what, let me wait. Another question, like, when I was using cursor, like a scroll back in a chat and revert any previous checkpoint, right? Yep. And like, I just called Clockhole. I didn't, is there a easy way to do that? Or like with AMP, is there a easy way to go? Yes. If you use the VS code, essentially, you can revert. In our current CLI, you can't, we're actually building that out now. But what's interesting is there's a lot of times where if I'm pretty concerned what I'm doing is not going to work, I'll just commit, and then I'll revert the commit. So, yeah. Yeah, just use get to do it. Yeah. Alright, so we'll say, yes, let's go ahead and do this. We're now messing with the database schema, which is always fun. I have to do a migration here, which I don't like. Yeah, the database is where things get screwed up. Yeah, hopefully. Yeah. But what's interesting, I mean, but again, this is where, if you're, you know, working from a PRD, you have a pretty detailed task list. You know, if you're going to have to change the database schema and do a migration, it's most likely going to be fine. Again, this is probably not the most exciting thing for you all to visually see, but I think seeing, you know, real software development happening with an agent and the way that actually looks and works, hopefully, it kind of gives you a behind the scenes view in that. This is still like infinitely easier than like writing code yourself, right? I mean, like, you know, like the parent after 9 p.m., like I can't write code myself. I can print these commands. And we can, yes, you can read, you know, you can speak into whisper flow a little bit. So alright, we're going to say, yes, let's keep cranking it. So it's interesting to kind of see all this happening, right? And see, well, how much of your code do you truly read now? How much are you relying on your tests? Yeah. And obviously, you want to be doing all of that. But it's interesting to see how this is playing out. You know, I think we just saw Mitchell Hashimoto, the creator of Ghosty, you know, one of the founders of Hashikorp recently say he's requiring all PRs that were AI assisted to clearly say so. Oh, okay. You know, which makes sense. And a lot of them do now. It says, you know, co-authored with AMP or co-authored with Cloud Code. So I mean, that's like, that's going to be like every PR man. I don't know. Yeah. So that's what I said. I think it's going to be like 99%. And we'll quickly get there. Let me actually just while we're writing for this thing to generate. Like you taught like a million people how to code, right? So like, but like, I'm sure when you taught it, it was about like learning loops and learning, like, you know, functions and stuff. Now, like, do you think this is the better way to learn how to code? Like you just get to see the bill stuff and then you ask questions about a code or how would you learn how to code it now? Yeah. Well, what's interesting is you're basically coding with a tutor now, right? That's right. And it's really down to the student about the depth of their knowledge, right? You know, as you know, I'm just going to keep this going. As you know, you actually don't need to understand the code to actually ship now. Now you should, right? Because that's a little scary if you're shipping and you have no idea what's actually happening. But you could technically do that. But the problem with that is that's sort of like, it's sort of like building a house and you have a robot that knows how to use a saw, right? And it's like, okay, well, you could do it. What if things start to break and you have no understanding of how, you know, the plumbing was put in or why that wall is there? So I think there's this very valuable, very, very, very valuable skill and understanding code still. And I think that's going to last for years. Yeah. How do you learn it is the question. So I think, you know, if A.I. had existed, at least large English models had existed when I was running Treehouse, it would have been completely different. And what we would have said is, okay, the learning experience is that you're going to sit down and you're going to chat with A.I. about something you care about, right? Let's go and keep this going. So should I proceed with that in the next group of types? Let's do it. Okay. And so you would say, you know, what's the me you care about? You know, is it Warhammer or is it basketball or is it selling, right? So you pick a topic you care about and then say, okay, well, what's something we should build for that topic that you care about, right? So if it's selling, you know, maybe you want to build a program that helps you design a pattern, right? Or say it's about basketball. Maybe you want to track, you know, your favorite MBAs all-star and keep track of their stats and have them loaded on your screen at the top right, right? So the key is to build some of you care about, right? And so I think everyone's like, well, I don't know how to code or I don't know how to build with agents. Just say, pick some of you care about and talk to an agent about that. Ask them to build it with you and explain as it goes, right? And I think that's the way people are going to learn in the future. Yeah, you should make a new three-step system for learning with A.I. There we go. It explains like, you know, how to architect your own everything. I like those. That's my next idea. Thank you. I'm going to steal that. Yeah. So now we're running some tests, right? And saying, well, is what we built actually going to work? I'm not really paying attention to code. Like, obviously, if I was coding, I wouldn't be chatting to Peter and sort of, you know, not really paying attention. But that's what's happening now. So this is sort of realistic. When can we get to, like, if we do step three, you know, step, we got to get all the way down to step five to see some UI? All right. Well, we've got, so we've got this assessment question, question of UI in step three. And so we're on step 2.6. So I think pretty quickly we're going to get to 3.1. And probably what we can say to the A.I. is I actually want you to create a static version of this. So I can see a mockup of it. And I may go back and actually revise this workflow a little bit. Because what I am learning is it's sometimes better to have the A.I. mock up a completely static version of the UI first. You know, no functionality. Just use tailwind and then show it to me, right? Yeah. And then that will actually flesh out a lot of confusion. Like, oh, wow, I didn't mean that. This is terrible. You know, let's not do that. So yeah, I think that's the best practice. Because it might change the database for something that you don't actually want. Right. I don't even care about that. So what are we doing? So let's go ahead. I'm going to actually interrupt this because it's just it's basically doing what we want, which is iterating through these tests. But I'm actually going to stop it. I actually want to skip to step 3 and just view the UI. Do a static version of the questionnaire UI just so I can see it and kind of make sure we're on the same page. All right. So AMP's going to say, what we were doing this whole process. Like, what are you doing? But what we'll do is we'll get hopefully is untangled your app like live and people are using it to manage their divorce. It's brand new. So we're basically essentially launched our first ads today. Wow. Exciting. Yeah. So if you go to untangled-us.com, you can see it. Hopefully none of you listening are going through divorce. But if you are, you can check it out. Actually, wow, this is building. I'll quickly show you what it looks like. So untangled is an app to help people get through divorce. But it's just for Connecticut. So I think this is a good example of the myriad of startups that we're going to see, where people solve a very specific vertical problem. And the idea is divorce in Connecticut is not a sexy startup problem to solve. Right? But the point of all of this is that this is a specific market that I think that I can help a lot of people with. And so I tackled it. And I think we're going to see thousands of startups like these. So it's going to be fun to see how it goes. And is only Connecticut because of that connect has their rules for mother states? Yeah. If you haven't been through divorce, you know this. But unfortunately, if you have, you're very aware that the divorce statutes are very different in each state. And the kind of painful thing, the reason why I showed this like pile of PDFs is because in Connecticut, there's 14 divorce forms with 2007 and 2007 unique fields that you have to fill out correctly. Lots. The nightmare, right? So there's a lot of fun features to build here. So that's anyway, that's what I'm building. That's what I'm tangling is. But let's take you back to the code and see how it's doing. All right. So we are back with AMP and NeoVim inside a ghosty. So it said it's created a static version of the relationship assessment questionnaire. UI, here's what I built. All right. So we're actually going to, let's create, let's get the, let me see one second. All right. We're going to start the dev server. All right. So we're running over on 3000. And then I think it said the URL is case new relationship, right? So let me hop back over. All right, everybody. We are back in a browser and we're going to go to local host. And we're going to fire this up. So we just started the web, uh, web dev server. And I believe it was case. Let me just check. It was at case relationship. Case new relationship. All right, everybody. So we've got the web developer, sorry, the web development server up and running. And you can see the very basic UI. Obviously, this is not rocket science. You can see, okay, we're doing a relationship assessment. We're asking, how, how would you describe your communication with your spouse? So Peter, how would you describe your communication with your spouse? Let's see, generate, can communicate. Not close to divorce yet. Yeah. We're good. How willing is your spouse to cooperate on divorce related decisions? Hopefully, hopefully, completely uncooperative. Hopefully, hopefully, it doesn't happen. Hopefully because you're not getting divorced at all. How do you describe the level of conflict? This is, um, I think, uh, low conflict with spouse, high conflict with the kids. It sounds like every, uh, every parenting marriage relationship in the world. How would you describe your spouse's emotional state regarding divorce? Yeah, she'll be disappointed. Like, you know, she's married to the best person in the world. So she'll be extremely upset. She'll be very upset if it happens here. Okay. So there we go. Okay. All right. So unfortunately, you are a high conflict because she's very upset. Oh, okay, okay, because, okay. Yeah. Okay. Well, I don't think I'm going to target audience. So hopefully, so hopefully you and, and no one watching is my target audience. So, yeah. But you can see, you know, the basic process, right? So I think actually what I would do is encourage people. And I'm actually probably going to go do a pull request on my own repo here is, is actually add the UI generation at the beginning, right? As soon as you do the PRD, um, because then you can flesh out a lot of these, uh, a lot of these issues early. So yeah, this is awesome. And so I want to talk a little about the right problems to solve as a AI solo founder. Like I actually really love the fact that you're doing this, uh, you know, connect a divorce problem. Like, you know, like all the 21 year olds are like, you know, I don't know what they're doing. They're like building fancy AI coding agents or like, yeah, in services. Got right. But like as a solo founder, I think, solving like a super high pain point for a niche audience, that's willing to pay a lot is it seems like a really good fit. You know, like how do you think about this? Yeah. So this, what's interesting is I didn't have an idea after Trials was required, right? I, because as everybody knows, when you start a company, you have to be passionate about a problem you want to solve. And you can't magic that out of nowhere, right? And so there was a period of time, I was like, I don't know how to build, right? Um, and then that's why I joined Intel. I thought, I'll just go learn about Silicon, right? I don't have the idea. And I saw one of learn how enterprise companies work because I've never worked in a massive, you know, 100,000 person company. So went and just learned. And then, you know, when I saw my sisters go through their divorce, I was like, why is this sucks so bad? And like, why is it so expensive? Like this doesn't seem like this should be happening. And it seems incongruous. And I think as a founder, whenever you feel that feeling, like, why is this like this? It shouldn't be like this. That's always the seed for the idea. And you can't, unfortunately, you can't manufacture that moment. Yeah. And, and I, I think you're right, like, this is not a sexy startup idea, right? But this could be a very real important company, right? Because it's solving something that really, really exists, you know, you either pay $15,000 up to $40,000 for your divorce or you pay $300 for Untangle. And then probably a couple thousand dollars of attorney fees, right? Yeah. So I would encourage people to think about real problems in their life. The last thing I'll say is, even though Triass was my most successful company financially, it was a hard startup. And the reason why is because what we were doing is selling a vitamin, not a pain pill. And I'm sure people have heard this analogy before, but you really want to tackle a problem or a build a company that is a pain pill, not a vitamin. And what I mean by that, so learning how to code is very something that you do because you want to get better, right? You do it because you want to be smarter. You do it because you want a better job, right? So that's why it's a vitamin. Whereas divorce is a pain pill. Like it's an acute, painful moment in your life that you want the pain to go away, right? And so if you can find a pain pill, it's always, it's always a better business than a vitamin. So be aware of that. You were leading like 100 employees or something, right? Like so how would you say, and I feel like a lot of people are kind of chasing that like they want to be in charge of a large team and so on so forth. So how do you compare life back then to now? We're just like, holy night. I love, you know, not having 100 employees. It's wonderful to grow a team and to take care of them and do the best you can and be successful and hire a lot of people. But it draws you away from doing. And so like I said, like, you know, in the beginning, I was a solo founder when I launched Drop Send, it was me. I coded it. You know, I did customer success and marketing and I did all of that. You know, and then you fast forward to Treehouse where you know, started it with a friend and then it grew and we hired hired and I got abstracted away from all the code. And I think we're now in a phase where you absolutely can be a one person company. And you know, the size of that company may not be as large as as a company with 10, 20, 100, 1000 employees, but that maybe isn't what you want. And so with Untangle, you know, I specifically decided to build it myself and I decided I'm going to bootstrap it. And I'm going to do everything myself. And it's just joyful like to be able to ship and build and know and understand and go as fast as I want. It's so amazing. Like what an amazing time to be a founder. Now, why did I join AMP? Because I want that there's another part of me that wants to empower as many people as possible to do what I do. Right. If I can empower a thousand, a million, you know, 10 million, a hundred million people to do what I'm doing with Untangle or to ship better software inside of their team and get a raise, you know, to build things that truly change the world. Like what an amazing opportunity. Right. Yeah. I wasn't going to go build another, you know, coding agent company. So it just made sense to build Untangle inside of AMP, you know. Yeah. I think Untangle has much higher success than another coding agent company. So yeah, I think the the battlefield is pretty set on the on the coding agent battlefield. And, you know, I believe AMP has a good chance to win that, but it's going to be a battle. Right. So I think this is really important. I think a lot of people haven't realized this. Like, now's the third time to be a solo AI founder any other time. And you don't have to, like, go raise VC funding and do all the crazy stuff, right? Because like, you know, if you're like a CEO of a 100% company, yeah, you're probably just in fact to fact 30 minute meetings like again, like all day, like nine hours a day. Yeah. I think I don't know if you can talk about this, but like it depends on what kind of lifestyle you want, right? And how much money you want to make. Yep. I think this is huge. And I want to give, you know, credit to Jason Fried and DHH, because they've been saying this stuff for like 20 years, right? Yeah. Where the idea is, you know, you can build a wonderful business that unlocks you financially and is much smaller, right? So you kind of imagine, okay, we'll say that I had a really well-paying job, you know, as an engineer. And I had, you know, benefits and a 401k. And, you know, how much money would I need to make per year? It's like a reasonable amount, but it's not millions, right? And then you think, well, wait a minute, like if I build my own company and it's basically me or me in a contractor, maybe me and one employee, you don't have to build a very big business to have at least as an amazing life as that. And then it could be much better because you just cash flow and become, you end up becoming wealthy, but the thing is you control your time, right? So if you pull out understanding the value of your time, right? And it may be sexy and exciting to be a Silicon Valley founder whose venture funded, right? But the truth is it is insane. Like you don't control your time at all, you know, you've got a board, you've got, you know, hundreds of employees to take care of and feed and protect and you've got competitors that are trying to kill you and you have no time, right? So I think you have to kind of balance these things and it's interesting because I think in the past, I did want to build a company that was, you know, sexy and huge and people would say, wow, Ryan built this huge company. And I don't care about that now. It's like, I want to work on a problem I care about. I want to work with people that I respect and I want to be able to control my time and take care of my family. And that actually is the ultimate wealth, right? So yeah, more powered everybody listening that wants to build a company by themselves, you absolutely can. For real now, like, you don't need anybody else. If you are a gentick yourself, wow. Yeah, that's my plan for my kids to get on this track to avoid the whole rarise, you know, man, we do. Yeah, we're all trying to like make our kids as a gentick as possible. Yeah, exactly. And say, you know, if you have any question ask an AI first, right? Because it's very likely you'll get way further. And just so one little sort of anecdote, it's kind of interesting joining AMP. I think I'm on day 22, maybe now. You know, an AMP is a big code base, right? And it's so wild to all you have to do is open up the repo in AMP and ask AMP a question and say, you know, like, where is in the code base? Does this happen? You know, and it figures it out. And then I'll say, well, which developer worked on it? Right? And I'll figure that out. And then I can go into Slack, for instance, and ask much smarter questions, right? I can go to the engineer who worked on it. I know exactly where, you know, the code is and what it does. And I can ask a very intelligent fast question that doesn't slow them down. And this is this is just an example of one thing in life you can do, like apply that to anything, right? We are so much more powerful now because of agents. It's just bonkers. Yeah, I totally agree. All right, man. So where can people find untangled and also AMP? So if you want to use the AMP, just go to AMP code.com. The cool thing is you can sign it for free. We give you 10 bucks to use it for free. So just have at it and hit me up on X. So I'm just Ryan Carson, right? So hit me up on X. Tell me you're using it. I'll cheer you on if you have any trouble. I'll make sure that we get it to the right person. So try it out. Have fun. Then if you want to find me, like I said, I'm just Ryan Carson everywhere, but I live and breathe on X all day. Every day. I love it. And then if you want to hopefully not get divorced in Connecticut, but if you are, just go to untangle-us.com. Yeah, let me know if you think. Awesome, Ryan. Yeah, it was great to connect with you on X. I think I have kind of like a love hate range of X, but you know, it's good to see you on there. And yeah, thanks for walking through everything. It's super practical. Thanks for your, appreciate it.
