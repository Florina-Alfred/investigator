Because there are some major updates in 2025 could have a big impact on your taxes, your paperwork and how you run your business. In today's episode, I will walk you through the four essential changes every small business owner in Germany should know about. Hello everyone, my name is Palaji and together with my wife, we create videos on German rules and regulations. Quick question, before we get going, are you already registered as a client-unter-nameer or do you plan to register this year?

We, you can book an app on with Vanakam Germany using the link given in description. We are not certified experts to guide you how to start a business in Germany, but we can share our personal experience how we establish Vanakam Germany since 2022. So don't wait, kindly click the link given in the description and we will wait for you. What is a client-unter-nameer? The government introduced this client-unter-nameer, to support small businesses and encourage more people to start companies, especially those testing a new idea or starting a business alongside a regular job. That was always a misunderstanding with this particular term. Vanakam-unter-nameer is not a type of company or a legal entity. It is a vat regulation under the section 19 of the German vat law. If your turnover stays under certain limits, you don't have to charge vat on your invoices or submit monthly pre-vat returns. The main benefits are, similar bookkeeping, no vat paperwork, lower prices for private customer. We have an earlier video explaining how the client-unter-nameer-regeling works with simple examples and I will show you once again for the reference here and also attach it in the cards. As you two people are providing the same services and same product in the market, one collects the umsert store and one doesn't collect the umsert store. So they obviously customer will prefer to buy a product from the person who is not collecting the umsert store because they can save their money. In that way, government is supporting the client-unter-nameer-people to motivate and run a business in Germany. But we have got the basics covered. Let's talk about the new changes for 2025. First one, the higher revenue limits. Up to 2024, you could be a client-unter-nameer if your previous year revenue was less than 22,000 and you expected revenue for the current year stayed under 50,000. But in 2025, these results are increased to 25,000 euros for the previous year, the net turnover and 100,000 euros for the current year, again net turnover. It's great news. It gives you more flexibility to grow your business. Let me explain with a simple example. Let's say my wife Priya runs a part-time consultancy. In 2024, she earned 21,000 euros and qualified for the client-unter-nameer status. In 2025, she experts 96,000 euros, still she qualifies. But if she experts 105,000 euros, she won't be eligible and will need to charge back to every customer. So do you think that these higher limits will make it easier for the people to become self-employed in Germany, drop a S or no in the comments? Ex-update is immediate loss of status. The old rule is if you went over the limit, you kept your client-nameer status until the following year. The new rule is 100,000 is now a strict cutoff. As soon you pass this limit, you lose your status and must start charging that immediately. Again an example scenario. Imagine you're running an online store for custom t-shirts. In October, the huge corporate order pushes an annual turnover to 102,000 euros. The next invoice after passing 100,000 euros must include that with no grace period. And you see how tracking your turnover throughout the year is super important. And in this case, what tools for apps do you use to monitor your finances for your business? Share your tips below. Ex-update is about the e-invoicing. The requirement starting in 2025, all business including client-nameer must be able to receive electronic invoices e-resheningant, informants like ex-reshening. For example, if a corporate customer sends you an invoice in this format, you will need suitable software to process it. Just excel or PDF won't always do the trick. Some popular accounting tools like Lexware, Sevdes and Billomat. Personally, we have been using Sevdes for years and highly recommended. If you want to open an account in Sevdes, you can also use our referral links, which is given in the description. Which accounting software do you use or are you still doing everything by hand? How prepared are you for the e-invoicing? Type your answers I would love to know it. Fourth point, higher threshold for full bookkeeping. In Germany, businesses can calculate profits with a simple cash-paces report. I and Namae, you were sure, Sreshening. Or they may need to have a full financial statement with a balance sheet. Up to now, you have to switch to do full accounting if you earn over 60,000 Euros profit or had more than 600,000 Euros in revenue. For the year 2025, these limits jump to 80,000 Euros profit or 800,000 Euros in revenue. Example, imagine you own a bakery and make a profit of 75,000 Euros in 2024. You can stick with your simple I and Namae, you were sure, Sreshening. In 2025, if you reach 80,000 Euros profit, then you must switch to the full double entry bookkeeping. So, these are the four major updates which has been implemented in the year 2025 for the client with the name of the regal. Which of these changes do you think will impact you the most? The race revenue limits, the immediate loss of status or the new invoicing rules? Traps up the most important changes to the client with the name of the regal in 2025.
