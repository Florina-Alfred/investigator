# Summary (qwen3)

- **Definition of AI Engineering and AI Engineer**
  - AI engineering is a field that shifts focus from traditional machine learning (ML) to more engineering and product-oriented approaches.
  - It involves using APIs to access pre-trained models rather than building models from scratch.
  - AI engineers focus on integrating AI into products, handling data pipelines, and ensuring model performance.
  - The role differs from traditional ML engineers, who focused more on model training and data collection.

- **Key Aspects of AI Engineering**
  - **Shift in Focus**: From ML to product and engineering.
  - **Reduced Barriers**: No need for extensive data or ML expertise.
  - **Focus on Evaluation**: Importance of evaluating AI models, including functional correctness, and the challenges of doing so.
  - **Engineering Practices**: Emphasis on system design, deployment, and maintenance of AI applications.

- **Typical Steps to Build an AI Application**
  - **Prompt Engineering**: Crafting effective prompts for model interaction.
  - **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Using retrieval systems to enhance model responses.
  - **Fine-Tuning**: Adjusting pre-trained models for specific tasks.
  - **Evaluation**: Using metrics and human judgment to assess model performance.
  - **Iterative Development**: Starting with a product idea, testing, and refining based on feedback.

- **Practical Tips for Software Engineers**
  - Start with prompting and simple models.
  - Use retrieval systems and data preparation to improve model performance.
  - Focus on understanding the problem and aligning AI solutions with user needs.
  - Use hybrid search approaches combining term-based and semantic retrieval.
  - Avoid over-reliance on complex models unless necessary.

- **Common Mistakes and Challenges**
  - Using GenAI when it's not necessary.
  - Overlooking user feedback and domain understanding.
  - Rushing into complex solutions without proper evaluation.
  - Underestimating the importance of data and manual inspection.
  - Not iterating and refining AI systems based on real-world use.

- **Learning and Development in AI Engineering**
  - **Project-Based Learning**: Applying knowledge to real projects to gain hands-on experience.
