- Core themes of “Forsaking Industrialism”  
  - Western (European and American) missed industrial opportunity due to EU regulation and intentional hostility  
  - EU policies unintentionally seeded China’s industrial platform  
  - Shift from internal combustion engines to electric vehicles, e‑bikes, and other electrified transport  
  - Role of venture capital and private investment in industrialization  
  - Critique of liberal neo‑conservative orthodoxy on markets and trade  
  - Prediction that domestic turmoil and polarization will erode growth and productivity  
  - Call for Western reindustrialization; tariffs alone are insufficient  

- Writing process  
  - Commitment to publish only when a compelling hook is present  
  - Monthly research, conversations with friends, and continuous reading  
  - Draft 5–6 k words, followed by 1–1.5 month editing  
  - Uses online searches, time‑filtered queries, Wikipedia, and anecdotal evidence  

- EU regulation and China’s industrial platform  
  - EU’s stringent regulatory framework imposes high fixed costs  
  - EU policies favor status‑quo firms and unintentionally push manufacturing to China  
  - China built a large, vertically integrated electrification platform that spans raw materials, batteries, components, and final products  

- KTM bankruptcy (Austria)  
  - EU regulations created high fixed costs  
  - Overproduction and COVID debt led to collapse  
  - Example of EU policies unintentionally benefiting China  

- Brilliance Auto (China)  
  - State‑owned automotive group that BMW must partner with to sell in China  
  - Story of a Chinese businessman’s equity seized by a local governor, illustrating China’s state‑enterprise system  
  - Highlights how Western firms must navigate state‑owned partners  

- Segway acquisition  
  - Segway’s patents used by Chinese e‑scooter manufacturers  
  - U.S. investment firm sued China, then bought Segway for $75 m  
  - Illustrates IP dynamics and shift of manufacturing to China  

- Platform economy vs industrial platform  
  - Industrial platform: regional, vertically integrated hub that reduces friction from research to production to logistics  
  - Tech platform: digital network that hosts multiple businesses  
  - China’s industrial platform is an example of a successful platform economy  

- Tariffs and industrialization  
  - Tariffs alone do not build factories, create jobs, or establish supply chains  
  - Need complementary measures: deregulation, infrastructure investment, talent pipelines, IP protection  

- Labor, capital, and unions  
  - Balance between labor and capital is crucial for productivity  
  - Excess labor costs stifle growth; excess capital neglects worker welfare  
  - Unions can both support and hinder innovation; incentives must align with long‑term industrial goals  

- AI and manufacturing  
  - AI improves design, simulation, and production efficiency  
  - Worries about automation reducing skilled labor demand  
  - Potential for high value‑added manufacturing if AI is integrated responsibly  

- Hypothetical presidential action plan  
  - Publicly announce a national industrial program with clear, non‑negotiable goals  
  - Strategically deploy tariffs to protect emerging sectors  
  - Establish regional industrial hubs, recruit executives, create workforce training pipelines  
  - Reform judiciary and prison system to address crime and enforce IP  
  - Encourage private capital participation while setting public‑private partnership guidelines  
  - Monitor political, economic, and social responses continuously
