## Key Themes

- **Industrial Revolution & Productivity**
  - Manufacturing must accelerate faster than historical trends.
  - Labor shortages cannot be solved by wage increases alone.
  - A productivity boom is the only viable path forward.

- **Schneider Electric’s Role**
  - 130 + years of U.S. presence, 200 global factories, 21 U.S. facilities.
  - $700 M+ recent U.S. investment; $1 B total in last few years.
  - Recognized as most sustainable company (Time, Corporate Night).
  - Sought to show sustainability and shareholder returns can coexist.

- **Technical Focus**
  - Emphasis on **software‑defined**, **open‑architecture** solutions.
  - Highlighted EcoStructure Automation Expert / Platform (first complete software‑defined architecture).
  - Use of digital twins, Aviva, ETAP for design‑to‑build optimization.
  - Transition to *physical AI* and *robotics* across manufacturing.
  - Data & connectivity reduce downtime, cost, energy use.

- **Business Examples**
  - **Lexington, KY** (panel board plant): 26 % energy cost drop, 20 % repair time cut via incremental, 1 % daily productivity improvements.
  - **Shell Client**: integrated data for 50 % downtime reduction, “open automation” implementation.
  - **Canadian Additive‑SLA Client**: “brewery‑style” booth demonstration for 5‑wheeler clients.

- **Sustainability & Energy Intersection**
  - Energy costs up 23 % in U.S., but still cheap market.
  - Data centers projected to account for 50 % of grid growth by 2035.
  - Holistic design required linking energy & automation.

- **Workforce & Education**
  - Only 15 % of Americans want manufacturing jobs; 80 % want U.S. manufacturing pursued.
  - Issues: aging workforce, talent pipeline, retention.
  - Suggested solutions: apprenticeship programs, robotics & AI exposure (middle‑school/high‑school), curriculum partnerships, open‑source training.

- **Strategic Vision**
  - Build *software‑defined* platforms that commoditize hardware, shift intelligence to software.
  - End‑to‑end system integration: design, build, operate, optimize.
  - Open systems win; closed systems become obsolete.
  - Co‑pilot development with Microsoft to ease automation programming.

- **Questions to Consider**
  - How does your organization integrate software‑defined solutions?  
  - What agility improvements can be realized?  
  - How are you preparing the next‑generation workforce?  
  - Will you act now or wait for “obvious” next steps?

- **Conclusion**
  - Call to lead change, manage discomfort, bridge skills gap.  
  - Open, software‑defined, data‑driven architecture as the future.  
  - Commitment to redefining American manufacturing.
