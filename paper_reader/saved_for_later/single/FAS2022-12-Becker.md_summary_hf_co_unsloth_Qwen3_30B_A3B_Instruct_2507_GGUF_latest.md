## **Abstract Summary**  
The paper introduces **Apex.OS**, the first mobility software platform designed to unify software development across all automotive domains—ranging from driver assistance systems and automated driving to in-vehicle infotainment and cloud integration. It presents a **safety-certified (ISO 26262 ASIL D)**, open-architecture **Software Development Kit (SDK)** that enables **software-defined vehicles (SDVs)** by abstracting hardware complexity, enabling cross-domain consistency, and supporting modern software engineering practices. The platform is built on a **proven foundation: ROS 2**, enhanced with real-time capabilities, deterministic execution, and rigorous functional safety certification processes. The work demonstrates that certifying open-source software to the highest automotive safety standard is achievable with strategic scope definition and tooling.

## **Introduction & Motivation**  
The automotive industry is undergoing a paradigm shift:
- **Hardware evolution**: Moving from distributed ECUs to **centralized high-performance computing platforms** (5th-gen E/E architecture).
- **Software lag**: Despite advanced hardware, software remains fragmented, proprietary, and non-integrated.
- **Challenges**: Rising software complexity, cybersecurity risks, inconsistent tooling, and lack of over-the-air (OTA) update readiness.

The goal: **Software-Defined Vehicles (SDVs)**—where software defines vehicle behavior, enabling continuous innovation, OTA updates, and ecosystem integration.

> *Key Insight:* Just as iOS and Android revolutionized mobile devices, a unified **automotive OS + SDK** is essential for scalable, secure, and rapid development in the mobility ecosystem.

---

## **Key Challenges in Achieving SDVs**
1. **Fragmented software ecosystems** across OEMs and suppliers.
2. **Lack of standardized architecture** and APIs.
3. **Slow development cycles** due to in-house OS development.
4. **Safety and security certification** takes years (3+ years).
5. **Ecosystem dominance**: Consumers use Apple/Android ecosystems, not vehicle-specific ones.

> *Conclusion:* No single OEM can build a competitive ecosystem alone. A **common, open, certified platform** is needed.

## **Lessons from Mobile & Robotics**
- **Mobile phones**: The iPhone (iOS) and Android SDK created winner-takes-all ecosystems by enabling **developer freedom**, **OTA updates**, and **app marketplaces**.
- **Robotics**: ROS (Robot Operating System) emerged as a de facto standard in robotics, but **ROS 1 failed in automotive production** due to:
  - Poor real-time performance
  - No safety certification
  - Inadequate security
  - Lack of lifecycle management
  - Non-standard middleware (not automotive-grade)

**ROS 2 (2018)** addressed these issues with:
- Real-time capabilities
- Support for **DDS (Data Distribution Service)** middleware
- **Modular, scalable architecture**
- **Open APIs**, strong developer tools
- **Lifecycle management**, security, and static configuration support

## **Apex.OS: A Safety-Certified Automotive SDK**
Apex.OS is a **proprietary fork of ROS 2** enhanced for **automotive safety and performance**.

### Core Design Principles
1. **Standardized software architecture with open APIs**  
   - Hourglass design: thin, unified middleware abstraction layer (ROS Middleware API) atop DDS.
   - Supports multiple backends (DDS, SOME/IP, etc.) → avoids vendor lock-in.

2. **Awesome developer experience**  
   - **ADE (Apex Development Environment)**: Docker-based, consistent development environments.
   - **Launch Testing Framework**: Open-source tool for integration, system, and acceptance testing across SIL/HIL/VIL environments.
   - Tools for recording, replaying, visualizing, simulating, and debugging.

3. **Scalability to massive systems**  
   - Proven in thousands of robots and autonomous vehicles.
   - Supports large teams, complex sensor fusion, and high-bandwidth data (e.g., 6 Gbps from LiDAR/cameras).
   - Efficient transport via **iceoryx** (zero-copy, low-latency messaging).

4. **Modern software engineering practices**  
   - Monolithic codebase with co-located artifacts (code, docs, tests, design).
   - CI/CD pipeline via **GitLab CI + Docker**.
   - Integrated IDE (CLion) with debugging, coverage, static analysis, and tool integration.

## **Certification to ISO 26262 ASIL D: A Major Achievement**
Apex.OS Cert is the **first open-source-based software stack certified to ISO 26262 ASIL D**—the highest automotive safety level.

### Certification Process Highlights:
- **Scope Definition**: Limited to core runtime and communication layer (initially), excluding external libraries.
- **Technical Safety Concept (TSC)**: Defined use cases (e.g., publisher-subscriber data flow) and ODD (Operational Design Domain).
- **Safety Case**: Internal document outlining safety objectives and artifacts.
- **Tool Confidence Level (TCL)**: Required qualification of all development tools (e.g., YAML parser, code generator).
- **Change Management & Safety Culture**: Enforced via FSLC (Functional Safety Lifecycle) practices.

### Technical Challenges & Solutions:
| Challenge | Solution |
|--------|---------|
| Low MC/DC coverage in C++ templates | Used modern coverage tools + custom fixes for lambda functions |
| Runtime memory allocation tracking | Repurposed **LTTng** (Linux tracing) for real-time monitoring |
| Non-deterministic execution | Replaced standard C++ containers with **custom static-memory containers** |
| Tool qualification (e.g., YAML parser) | Switched to **proprietary, certified tools** due to open-source limitations |

> **Result**: Achieved certification in **record time**—demonstrating that open-source software **can** be safely certified with proper strategy.

## **Applications & Use Cases**
Apex.OS is applicable beyond autonomous driving:
- **Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS)**
- **Automated Driving (L2–L5)**
- **In-Vehicle Infotainment (IVI)**
- **Connected & Shared Mobility**
- **Smart Machines & IoT Devices**
- **Cloud Integration & OTA Updates**

## **Future Work & Outlook**
- Expand **technical safety concept** to cover more complex scenarios.
- Certify **core libraries** (e.g., transport layer, middleware).
- Integrate with **AUTOSAR Adaptive** and **SOME/IP** protocols.
- Broaden ecosystem adoption across OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers.
