## **Title**:  
*A Safety-Certified Automotive SDK to Enable Software-Defined Vehicles*  
**Author**: Jan Becker (CEO & Co-Founder of Apex.AI, Inc., and Lecturer at Stanford University)

---

## **Core Thesis**  
The paper argues that the automotive industry is at a pivotal moment: hardware architectures are rapidly centralizing (toward a single high-performance computing platform), but software development lags behind—leading to fragmented, non-scalable, and unsafe systems. To enable **Software-Defined Vehicles (SDVs)**, the industry needs a **unified, safety-certified, open, and developer-friendly software platform**—an **automotive SDK** akin to iOS or Android. The authors introduce **Apex.OS**, the first such platform certified to **ISO 26262 ASIL D**, enabling end-to-end integration across all vehicle domains.

## **Key Motivations & Industry Context**

1. **Hardware vs. Software Mismatch**:  
   - Modern vehicles are moving from distributed ECUs (via CAN bus) to **centralized high-performance computing platforms** (5th-gen E/E architecture).
   - This shift demands **complex, integrated software**—but current software practices are still siloed and proprietary.

2. **Market Pressure & Ecosystem Shift**:  
   - Automakers are trying to build their own digital ecosystems (like Apple/Android), but users prefer existing platforms (e.g., smartphones).
   - Vehicles are now just one device in a larger **mobility ecosystem**, competing with phones, smart homes, and IoT.

3. **The “Winner-Takes-All” OS Reality**:  
   - History shows that mobile OS markets favor one dominant platform (iOS and Android).
   - Automotive OEMs cannot afford to build isolated, non-interoperable OSes; they need a **common, open, scalable platform**.

---

## **Why a Common OS & SDK?**

- **Ecosystem value scales with size**: Larger developer bases → richer applications → faster innovation.
- **Cost & time savings**: Avoid reinventing the wheel; reuse proven tools, APIs, and frameworks.
- **Safety & certification**: Building from scratch takes years; reusing a certified base accelerates time-to-market.

> ❗ *Many OEMs are attempting in-house OS development by 2025—but this is unrealistic without a foundation. Safety certification alone takes 2–3 years.*

## **The Solution: Apex.OS – A Safety-Certified Automotive SDK**

Apex.OS is a **proprietary fork of ROS 2**, re-engineered for **automotive safety, real-time performance, and production readiness**.

### ✅ Key Design Principles (from the 5Cs framework):
- **Configuration**  
- **Coordination**  
- **Composition**  
- **Communication**  
- **Computation**

These are implemented via a **modular, open, and extensible architecture**.

---

## **Technical Foundations & Innovations**

### 1. **Architecture: The "Hourglass" Model**
- **Core**: A single, standardized codebase (ROS 2 middleware layer).
- **Middle**: Open APIs (ROS 2 client libraries in C++/Python).
- **Top & Bottom**: Plug-in support for multiple middleware (e.g., DDS, SOME/IP), OSes, and hardware.
- **Benefits**: Avoids vendor lock-in, enables portability, and supports scalability.

### 2. **Real-Time & Determinism (Critical for Safety)**
- ROS 1 lacked real-time guarantees; ROS 2 improved this, but not enough for ASIL D.
- **Apex.OS** rewrites core components (e.g., memory management, threading) to ensure:
  - **Deterministic execution**
  - **Zero dynamic memory allocation**
  - **Static memory usage**
  - **Predictable latency**

### 3. **Developer Experience (DX)**
- **ADE (Apex Development Environment)**: Docker-based, consistent development environments across teams.
- **Launch Testing Framework**: Enables **system, integration, and acceptance testing** across SIL/HIL/VIL environments.
- **Tooling**: Full CI/CD integration (GitLab, Clion), code coverage (gtest, valgrind), documentation (Doxygen), and requirements traceability (JAMA).

### 4. **Scalability & Performance**
- Proven in robotics and autonomous vehicles with **tens of thousands of users**.
- Optimized transport via **iceoryx** (zero-copy, high-throughput).
- Efficient CPU/memory use even under 6 Gb/s data loads.

## **Achieving ISO 26262 ASIL D Certification: A Breakthrough**

This is the **first time** a **large open-source codebase (ROS 2)** has been successfully **certified to ASIL D** (highest safety level).

### Steps Taken:
1. **Defined a Technical Safety Concept (TSC)**:
   - Focused on **data communication** (publisher/subscriber) as the initial use case.
   - Limited scope to **source code only** (initially excluding libraries).

2. **Built a Safety Case**:
   - Documented safety objectives, hazard analysis, risk mitigation.
   - Passed internal safety audit with tacit approval.

3. **Tool Qualification (TCL)**:
   - Identified and qualified development tools (e.g., YAML parser, code generators).
   - Replaced open-source tools with **certified proprietary alternatives** due to lack of source access.

4. **Overcame Technical Challenges**:
   - **Coverage**: Used modern tools to achieve 100% MC/DC coverage (even for complex C++ templates).
   - **Memory Safety**: Replaced standard containers with **custom static containers** (string, vector, map/set).
   - **Runtime Determinism**: Used **LTTng** (Linux tracing) to detect dynamic allocations and blocking calls.
   - **Defensive Coding**: Used **GoogleMock** to test edge cases.

> ✅ Result: Apex.OS Cert achieved **ASIL D certification in record time**, thanks to reuse of a proven architecture and rigorous safety process.

  - Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS)
  - E-mobility & powertrain control
  - In-vehicle infotainment (IVI)
  - IoT and smart machines
