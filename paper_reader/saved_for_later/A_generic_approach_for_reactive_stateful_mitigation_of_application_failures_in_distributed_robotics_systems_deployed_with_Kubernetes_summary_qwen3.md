## Abstract
Offloading computationally expensive algorithms to the edge or cloud is an attractive option to overcome limitations in on-board computational and energy resources of robotic systems. However, complex robotic systems interacting with the physical world pose unique challenges not addressed by existing cloud-native failure mitigation approaches. This paper proposes a novel, application-agnostic, reactive stateful failure mitigation system for distributed robotic systems deployed using Kubernetes (K8s) and ROS2. The system employs Behaviour Trees to enable arbitrary complexity in monitoring and mitigation strategies. It preserves the last healthy state of the robotic system before a failure and allows recovery without disrupting task execution. The approach is validated on two example applications: Autonomous Mobile Robot (AMR) navigation and robotic manipulation in a simulated environment.

## Introduction & Motivation
Modern robotics increasingly relies on cloud-native technologies like Kubernetes and ROS2 to manage complex, distributed systems. However, traditional cloud-native failure mitigation approaches are not suitable for robotics due to the real-time interaction with the physical world. The paper addresses the need for stateful, reactive failure mitigation in distributed robotics systems, which can preserve the last healthy state and resume tasks seamlessly after a failure. The key contributions are:
1. A stateful, reactive failure mitigation system based on Behaviour Trees.
2. A robotics-specific workload monitoring system using introspection and external supervision.
3. Recovery strategies balancing system downtime and computational resource usage.

## Methods / Approach
The paper proposes a system that combines:
- **Monitoring System:** Uses introspection (monitoring system diagnostics and KPIs) and external supervision (sensor data and behavioral analysis).
- **Failure Mitigation:** Based on Behaviour Trees to encapsulate complex strategies, allowing for arbitrary complexity in recovery.
- **State Recovery:** Preserves the last healthy state of the system and transfers it after recovery.
- **Recovery Strategies:** Four strategies are presented, each with different trade-offs between recovery time and resource usage.

---

## Experiments / Data / Results
### Experimental Setup
The approach is validated on two applications:
1. **AMR Navigation:** Using Turlebot 4 and WidowX-200 robotic arm in Gazebo.
2. **Robotic Manipulation:** Using ROS2 frameworks Nav2 and MoveIt2.

### Recovery Time and Resource Usage
- **Recovery Time (t_recovery):** Composed of detection, cluster-level mitigation, and application-level reinitialization.
- **CPU Usage:** Measured using CAdvisor, with strategies like "restart from scratch" consuming the least resources but being the slowest.
- **Fallback Workloads:** Strategies using initialized fallback workloads offer faster recovery but consume more resources.

### Key Findings
- **Fallback in Execution Mode:** Fastest recovery but highest resource usage.
- **Uninitialized Fallback:** Offers a good balance between downtime and resource usage.
- **Scaling Considerations:** For large fleets, uninitialized fallbacks are more efficient due to lower resource overhead.

## Discussion & Analysis
The proposed approach is a significant step towards making distributed robotic systems resilient against application failures. It provides a flexible and scalable solution that can be adapted to various robotic tasks. The use of Behaviour Trees allows for the encoding of complex monitoring and mitigation logic, which is essential for handling the dynamic and unpredictable nature of robotic systems interacting with the physical world.

## Conclusions
The paper presents an application-agnostic, reactive stateful failure mitigation system for distributed robotic systems using Kubernetes and ROS2. The system preserves the last healthy state of the system, enabling seamless task resumption after failures. The approach is validated on two applications, demonstrating its effectiveness and flexibility. Future work includes extending the system to handle microservice-oriented architectures and integrating it into larger orchestration solutions.
