Abstract -Developing table tennis robots that mirror human speed, accuracy, and ability to predict and respond to the full range of ball spins remains a significant challenge for legged robots. To demonstrate these capabilities we present a system to play dynamic table tennis for quadrupedal robots that integrates high speed perception, trajectory prediction, and agile control. Our system uses external cameras for highspeed ball localization, physical models with learned residuals to infer spin and predict trajectories, and a novel model predictive control (MPC) formulation for agile full-body control. Notably, a continuous set of stroke strategies emerge automatically from different ball return objectives using this control paradigm. We demonstrate our system in the real world on a Spot quadruped, evaluate accuracy of each system component, and exhibit coordination through the system's ability to aim and return balls with varying spin types. As a further demonstration, the system is able to rally with human players.

## I. INTRODUCTION

Table tennis is a fast-paced sport, requiring split second perception, prediction, strategizing, and response. In a competitive table tennis game, a player can move up to 2 . 25 m in less than a second to accurately hit a 4 cm diameter ball with a 15 cm diameter paddle, all while making strategic decisions in fractions of a second [1].

For a robot to accurately control the trajectory and spin of a ping pong ball, it must solve four problems: ball perception, trajectory prediction, aiming, and swinging. First, the robot must accurately localize the ball which can travel at up to 10 m s -1 with 600 rad s -1 of spin [2], [3]. Next, to know where and when to strike the ball, the robot needs to anticipate its motion and estimate spin. To hit a ball on this predicted trajectory to a desired landing location with a specific spin, a planner must create different swing types to strike the ball with the appropriate speed and angle. Finally, to execute this plan the robot must control its joints to ensure an accurate strike. Solving this series of problems at the speed of table tennis makes precise ball control an excellent case study for dynamic robotic control.

Existing table tennis robot systems generally consist of a robotic arm either attached to a fixed base, e.g., [4]-[6], limiting their range of movement, or include a customized fast-moving gantry, e.g., [7], which reduces the challenge of agile motion control at the expense of generalizability across robot platforms. In contrast, quadrupedal or bipedal

legged robots must move with constraints similar to those of a human, trading off high speed motion and active balance.

Our system uses a Boston Dynamics Spot equipped with a six degree of freedom (DoF) arm (Fig. 1) and addresses the core challenges for robotic table tennis. We evaluate the accuracy of our ball localization and prediction systems using ground truth position data from a Vicon motion capture system, and ground truth spin data from a Spinsight Elite [3]. We assess our model predictive controller performance on hardware with demonstrations of returning balls across a range of speeds and spins while aiming at three different targets locations. To achieve these spins and positions, the controller exhibits emergent behavior that mirrors stroke strategies common in human players. Finally, we validate our controller on hardware by rallying with our system.

Our key contribution is the introduction of a Spot quadruped table tennis system capable of handling and generating competitive spin. Within this system, we developed a novel MPC formulation that can handle the continuous constraints of swing planning. We present our full system design, which consists of the following:

- High-speed perception to accurately localize the ball
- Trajectory prediction to estimate ball state and trajectory
- Aiming planner to choose a paddle state from a desired target and outgoing spin.
- Quadruped MPC controller to strike the incoming ball

Notably, our system is able to return incoming spin of up to 280 rad s -1 and impart outgoing spin of up to 200 rad s -1 , surpassing prior work, e.g., [9], [10].

## II. RELATED WORK

## A. Robot Racket Sports

Robots playing sports is a common challenge to foster robotics research to match the dynamic motion of humans and animals. Racket sports especially have become a popular test bed because of the need for agility and planning. Prior work has developed robot systems to play tennis [11]-[14] and badminton [15], [16]. Because of the pace of the game, table tennis stands out within racket sports as a preferred robotics research challenge.

## B. Perception in Table Tennis Robot

Prior works in robotic table tennis perception primarily address ball localization [7], [17]-[20], trajectory prediction [17], [19], [21], [22], and spin estimation [19], [22], [23]. Like some existing systems [7], [18], [22], we employ a pair of high-speed RGB cameras for ball localization. Many simpler trajectory prediction methods, however, disregard ball spin [11], [21]. This omission is problematic because ball flight, and contact dynamics are significantly influenced by spin [24] making it a critical component of the game. Some prior works estimate spin based on ball trajectory [17], [22]. Alternatively, Gossard et al. [25] track nonregulation markings on the ball for precise spin estimation, which is incompatible with standard play. Other methods infer spin from human player poses [23], but this approach relies on noisy human pose measurements. Our system builds upon the methods of Tebbe et al. [22] by adding a learned neural network to the model-based estimate from trajectory curvature. This approach improves future state prediction accuracy and handles incoming spin without the need for ball markings or human position estimation.

## C. Control in Table Tennis Robot

To play table tennis effectively, the robot needs to perform accurate swing motions with high agility. Most prior works focus on control systems for a fully actuated robot arm that is either fixed or attached to a fast moving gantry. Systems often use human demonstration to construct motion primitives [26] or as training data for imitation learning [27]. Reinforcement learning algorithms, e.g., [6], [16], [28] are often employed to synthesize table tennis skills, but require large quantities of simulated or real world data to perform effectively. These techniques also require separate controllers for categorized shots [28] because of the motion diversity of table tennis swings. Model-based methods also demonstrate effective control synthesis, e.g., [4], [29], without the need for data and can achieve greater shot diversity with a single controller. Our controller extends model-based methods for robot table tennis to handle the challenges presented by legged robots including balance.

Concurrent to our work, [21] uses reinforcement learning to train a humanoid robot to play table tennis. In contrast

The black motion capture cameras, located in the background, observe the position of the robot. The target ball landing location is in red on the table.

to their reliance on using human motion capture data to bootstrap the stroke strategies, we demonstrate a wide range of stroke strategies common in human players that automatically emerges from solving MPC. We also demonstrate that our control system can both handle incoming spin and generate it using swings such as loops and chops which add top and back spin to the ball respectively.

## III. SYSTEM

In this section, we describe our system (shown in Figure 2), including the perception, prediction, aiming, and control subsystems.

## A. Ball Detection and Localization

The perception system is responsible for detecting and localizing the table tennis ball in 3D space. This task is accomplished through a stereo camera setup, a camera calibration procedure, and a high-speed detection pipeline.

1) Camera Setup and Calibration: The system utilizes two Power over Ethernet (PoE) RGB cameras (Lucid Arena), each with a resolution of 1400x1080 pixels, capturing images at 165 frames per second (fps). The cameras are mounted on the ceiling at opposite ends of the table and angled downwards to view the entire playing surface (see Figure 2). To enable 3D reconstruction, both intrinsic and extrinsic camera parameters are needed. The intrinsic parameters are obtained from the specifications of the manufacturer. The extrinsic parameters are computed relative to a world coordinate frame whose origin is fixed at the center of the table. This calibration is achieved through a semi-automated process where key points corresponding to the table's corners are manually identified in a static image from each camera. Given the known 3D coordinates of these corners in the world frame and their corresponding 2D pixel coordinates, the extrinsic calibration (rotation and translation) for each camera is calculated by solving the Perspective-n-Point (PnP) problem [30].

<!-- image -->

- 2) Ball Detection and Localization: Our ball detection pipeline is a two-stage process designed for high-speed performance, similar to the approach in [11].
- 1) Motion Detection: For each incoming image stream, a background subtraction algorithm first identifies dynamic regions of the image. This operation isolates moving objects, primarily the ball, from the static background.
- 2) Object Detection: The segmented moving regions are then composited into a smaller 480x480 pixel image patch. A fine-tuned YOLO convolutional neural network (CNN) [31], [32] is applied to this composite patch to detect the ball's 2D pixel coordinates. This approach significantly reduces computational load by avoiding the need to run the CNN on the full-resolution image. The YOLO network was refined on a custom dataset of these composite patches to handle the domain shift from standard datasets.

Once the ball is detected in both camera streams at pixel coordinates ( u 1 , v 1 ) and ( u 2 , v 2 ) , its 3D position P = [ X,Y,Z ] T in the world coordinate frame is calculated using stereo triangulation and passed to the prediction system.

- 3) Performance: With cameras operating at 165 fps (an interval of 6 ms per frame), the entire detection process is completed in approximately 4 ms (2.5 ms for background subtraction and 1.5 ms for CNN inference). This low latency ensures that a detection result is available well before the next frame is captured.

## B. Ball Trajectory Prediction and Spin Estimation

To predict when and where the robot must strike the ball, we require an estimate of the ball's linear and angular velocity from ball position measurements. We used methods proposed by Tebbe et al. [22] for both ball velocity ( v ) and spin ( ω ) estimation. This process includes fitting polynomials to the history of ball positions and taking their derivatives for an approximation of v . To estimate ω , we sample a grid of these velocity points and construct a discrete approximation of the dynamics in (1).

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where C D and C M represent the lumped coefficients of the drag and Magnus effects respectively. By rearranging using the skew-symmetric matrix into equation (2) and stacking for all v i from the original velocity grid, we can perform a least squares solve for ω assuming it stays unchanged throughout ball flight.

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

This technique from Tebbe et al. [22] provides an estimate of spin given an analytical model, the performance of which is shown in Figure 3 on the left. All ground truth spin values were captured using a Spinsight Elite ball tracking system alongside custom marked balls. This system was also used for the characterization of parameters C M and C D .

To refine any unmodeled effects from our initial state estimate, we trained a residual network on 650 unique ball trajectories with varying spin. For data augmentation, we performed five random rotations about the z-axis and added them to the dataset. We then trained a small network with inputs ω from the least squares estimate and the polynomial coefficients to indicate curvature. Using R 2 as a performance metric, our learned residual improved the purely model-based approach from a 0.42 to 0.70 as seen in in Figure 3.

Using our state estimate, we integrate the ball trajectory given the same dynamics from (1) along with the table rebound model from Nonomura et al. [24]. The integration stops when the ball reaches a fixed strike plane located 0 . 5 m in front of the quadruped base. The terminal ball state is then reported to the aiming controller to choose a paddle state.

## C. Strike Aiming

Using the anticipated ball state provided from the prediction system, we must find a contact paddle state that returns the ball to the other side of the table. This paddle state is described using p des , v des, and n des , the paddle positon, velocity, and face normal vector respectively.

To choose these parameters, we designed a high-level aiming controller that takes in the desired landing position p land , spin ω + , and landing time t land and produces the desired paddle state. This problem is formulated as a constrained optimization in (3a)-(3e).

where r b and ˙ r b ∈ R 3 × N are the ball positions and velocities post collision and N is the number of trajectory nodes. f contact

The simulated resulting trajectory is shown in orange and p land is indicated with the green point. The lighter colored components represent intermediate solutions during the SQP iterations.

represents the paddle and ball contact dynamics which are a modified version of those in [24] using vector operations rather than rotation matrices. This simplified the number of instructions in the formulation in contrast to using two sets of frame rotations. f aero corresponds to the discrete aerodynamics in (1) and x b = [ r ⊺ b , ˙ r ⊺ b , ω + ⊺ ] ⊺ signifies the full ball state for simplified notation.

To solve this optimization problem in real time, we implemented Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) where we take a quadratic approximation of our cost with linearized constraints and solve that problem iteratively to handle any nonlinearity of the original problem. For our local QP solver, we utilize OSQP [33] and perform four SQP iterations before using the solution. All optimization formulations in this paper were generated using CasADi for fast function evaluation [34].

The convergence of the controller to an accurate numerical solution is shown in Figure 4 where three shot types were tested: a flat paddle drive, a top spin loop, and back spin chop. For each of the displayed solutions, the inputs to the optimization problem were constant other than ω + which resulted in drastically different solutions for v des and n des . The orange path of the ball is a simulated ball trajectory given the paddle state solutions during solve convergence. In all three cases, the controller converges to an accurate solution within four iterations which takes only 1 ms .

## D. Whole Body Model Predictive Control

To achieve the desired paddle state from the aiming controller and prediction system, we designed a model-based kinematic planner coupled with a whole-body controller that generates dynamically feasible swings.

1) Kinematic Planner: To generate a swinging motion that can adapt to changing strike conditions and plan for a return trajectory, we require a constraint that starts at the end of our planning horizon and moves closer to the beginning as we execute our motion. This proves challenging for MPC formulations like multiple shooting or direct collocation because of their discrete dynamics and the continuous nature of this strike constraint. For this reason, our kinematic planner uses parametric Bezier curves rather than discrete nodes. This allows for a single strike constraint that can be enforced anywhere along the planning horizon.

Equations (4a)-(4h) showcase this optimization formulation with q c ∈ R 24 × 8 representing the Bezier curve control points for each joint. In the equation, the Bezier curve result is calculated using function B with the time and Bezier curve parameters as inputs.

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Equations (4b) and (4c) ensure the planned trajectory starts at the current state of the robot while the joint limits are constrained in (4d). K f represents the forward kinematics of each foot in equation (4e) which keeps them stationary throughout the swing. Both (4d) and (4e) are enforced at sampled points along the Bezier curves. Finally (4f)-(4h) drive the end effector to match the desired paddle strike conditions at the strike time t s . Here, K p and K n are the forward kinematics for the center of the paddle and a point above the paddle face respectively.

To keep the end effector and other kinematic constraints decoupled, we add slack decision variables q s and ˙ q s ∈ R 24 which are the joint and body state of the robot at strike. Equations (5a) and (5b) constrain these variables to lie along the planned Bezier curves at t s .

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

To shape the swing, cost function f a limits the robot's acceleration while f r keeps its position close q rest , the rest stance. Because of the low distortion between the Bezier control points and the curve they parametrize, we can formulate these functions simply using the decision variables to keep the problem quadratic like in equation (6).

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Fig. 5: Variety of swing types including loop (top spin), drive (no spin), and chop (back spin).

where W j ∈ R 24 × 24 is a diagonal weighting matrix on each joint. Although indirect, this cost function keeps all control points close to the rest position q rest which regularizes q c without the need of computing any curve points. Similarly, we can minimize an acceleration proxy through f a in equation (7a) alongside slack variable constraint (7b).

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Similar to the strike constraints, slack variables ¨ q c are introduced here to keep the cost quadratic and remove any coupling terms between control points.

Together, both f a and f r create a simple convex cost function that regularizes the swinging motion. An additional benefit of this formulation is that we can also utilize this optimization problem for returning to our rest position. If we disable constraints (4f)-(4h) then the solution to our optimization problem becomes a smooth trajectory back to the rest position from our current state. Therefore, this one problem can both plan for swings and return trajectories.

We use the same SQP solver as the aiming system to solve this swing optimization problem. Because our cost is already quadratic, this solver only handles the constraint nonlinearity through multiple solves. During execution, we solve five SQP iterations instead of solving to convergence which allows the controller to run at 100 Hz .

2) Whole Body Controller: With this kinematic motion planner, we can now generate future trajectories that will meet our strike conditions, but we require a method of generating feedforward torques that abide by our dynamics. This can be accomplished using a whole-body controller which finds feedforward torques u given dynamics constraints with the goal of achieving a desired acceleration ¨ q des . This optimization is formulated in (8a)-(8c).

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where M , C , and τ g are the mass matrix, Coriolis terms, and gravity terms respectively of the general robotic manipulator equations. The ground reaction forces are also solved for and denoted by λ ∈ R 12 while J is the Jacobian of the robot feet with respect to q . To keep the constraints linear, the friction cone FC is approximated using a pyramidal approach. Together, this problem is a simple Quadratic Program and easily solved with off-the-shelf solvers, in this case OSQP [33].

With this combination of kinematic MPC planning and the dynamic whole-body controller, we are able to execute dynamic swings on hardware with a re-planning frequency of 100 Hz . Five swings from this controller are shown in Figure 5, each with the strike state shown along with the swing motion.

## IV. EVALUATIONS

## A. Ball Localization

The performance of the RGB-based ball detection subsystem was quantitatively evaluated against ground truth Vicon motion capture data. A table tennis ball, outfitted with retro-reflective markers, was moved throughout the detection region while its position was tracked concurrently by both motion capture and our RGB detection systems. The resulting position measurement errors are presented as violin plots in Figure 6. The distributions indicate that the median error for each axis remains below 1 cm, demonstrating the high accuracy of our perception module.

Time Before Strike

Fig. 7: Prediction output errors through ball flight with median and inter-quartile range (IQR). The 7 . 5 cm threshold for position error corresponds to the paddle radius, the minimum position accuracy require to strike the ball.

## B. Spin Estimation and Prediction

Using a set of 600 recorded ball trajectories, we evaluated the performance of the prediction module by comparing the predicted and true final ball state as it approached the strike plane. Figure 7 shows these errors in prediction timing, position, velocity, and spin.

The data indicates that our state estimate error reduces as more measured positions become available. Notably, the spin estimation converges to under 55 rad s -1 within 150 ms of the strike which provides time for the swing controller to adapt. The increase in spin estimation error at -0 . 4 s can be explained by our system waiting for 30 ball detection points before estimating spin.

## C. Swing Controller

To understand how well our swinging controller can achieve arbitrary paddle states within the strike plane, we tested three types of swings at a dense grid of positions summing to 3750 samples. Each point was generated by simulating the kinematic planner and whole-body controller throughout a full swing while capturing the state of the robot at the time of strike. For each data point we then evaluated the paddle position, velocity, and orientation errors over the grid of tested positions as seen in Figure 8. A threshold of 7 . 5 cm , 1 m s -1 , and 20 ◦ for position, velocity, and orientation error was set to bound the heatmap regions which represent the strike workspace of our controller and robot.

Fig. 8: Position, velocity and orientation error of the paddle at strike tested with loop, chop, and drive shots at an array of positions.

<!-- image -->

The position error heatmap indicates the best performance directly to the right and left of the robot with further and closer strikes being harder to reach. Within the position error bounds, the robot has velocity tracking error of under 0 . 5 m s -1 . On the other hand, the orientation error has a unique pattern with the best performance close and far from the robot. This result is likely related to our nonlinear and inequality orientation constraint which can be hard to solve for given the low number of SQP iterations during run time.

## D. System

To evaluate how well the system works as a whole, we struck 150 balls and recorded their landing locations with three different p land values. Figure 9 includes the recorded landing locations for each target marked as a return or miss. Over the 150 trials, 90.1% were returned with a clear aiming pattern given p land .

The state estimation and prediction system utilizes a residual network on top of a model-based estimator for ω -. We tested the necessity for these components with a small ablation, which included no spin estimation, only modelbased, and the full residual estimator. To choose the outgoing spin ω + , we implemented a simple heuristic strategy used

Fig. 9: Landing locations when aiming to the right, center, and left. Shots originated from Spot on the right of the plot.

<!-- image -->

by players to return shots with the same spin as they are received. For each setup, we tested five different spin values shown in Table I and recorded the return rate over 25 trials.

TABLE I: Return rate for different incoming ball spin ω -y with changing degrees of spin detection. Negative ω -y correspond to top spin while positive values indicate back spin.

|            | Spin Detection   | Spin Detection   | Spin Detection   |
|------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| ω - y      | None             | Least Squares    | Residual         |
| 220 rad/s  | 0%               | 28%              | 44%              |
| 100 rad/s  | 12%              | 52%              | 72%              |
| 0 rad/s    | 72%              | 68%              | 84%              |
| -125 rad/s | 12%              | 44%              | 88%              |
| -280 rad/s | 40%              | 68%              | 88%              |
| Mean       | 27.2%            | 52.0%            | 75.2%            |

This shows the need for the spin estimation and the improvement of return performance when the residual network is included. Overall, the full system was capable of handling a wide variety of ball spin with a mean return rate of 75%.

Since the aiming system is capable of solving for the exiting ball spin ω + , we tested the system's accuracy in generated this spin. Table II includes the mean and standard deviation over 25 trials for four different target spin values.

TABLE II: Mean and standard deviation of ball spin added by Spot for different desired spin speeds. Here, positive values correspond to top spin and negative to back spin.

| ω + y      | Mean         | Std. Dev.   |
|------------|--------------|-------------|
| 200 rad/s  | 191.9 rad/s  | 16.5 rad/s  |
| 125 rad/s  | 118.1 rad/s  | 15.0 rad/s  |
| -125 rad/s | -133.1 rad/s | 11.5 rad/s  |
| -200 rad/s | -182.6 rad/s | 24.0 rad/s  |

Over the four targets, the system is capable of getting within 20 rad/s of the desired ω + showing its ability to generate diverse spin. Examples of back spin and top spin shots are shown in Figure 10.

## E. Table Tennis Game Play

The quantitative evaluations above show how each subcomponent operates well and that the integrated system is capable of handling spin as well as aiming. Qualitatively, our system also supports playing table tennis with a person and is able to sustain a rally of over 10 hits per player all while handling spin from the opponent.

## V. CONCLUSIONS

We introduce a system that allows a quadrupedal robot equipped with a robotic arm to play table tennis. Our approach coordinates high-speed camera-based ball detection and localization, ball trajectory and spin prediction, aiming optimization, and whole-body model predictive control. This integration allows for agile and accurate table tennis play on a Spot robot. We evaluate our system on hitting accuracy, and demonstrate its ability to handle and generate ball spin. Future work aims to address the following limitations:

1) Perception: The current system relies on off-board cameras for ball detection. While prior work has developed onboard perception for slower racket sports such as badminton [15], extending this to table tennis which involves substantial rapid body movements remains a significant research challenge.

2) Prediction: Human players often rely on observing the movements of their opponents to estimate ball spin and plan strategy. Developing a prediction pipeline that can extract useful information from motions of an opponent will also be an important part of future table tennis robots.

3) Control: A key limitation of our current controller is that it excludes stepping due to the challenges of real-time, contact-implicit optimization. To overcome this limitation, a hybrid approach combining a reinforcement learning-based method [15], [21] with our proposed MPC could enable the robot to perform the agile footwork essential in human table tennis, while still leveraging the MPC for efficient online swing planning.

4) Strategy: Currently, our stroke strategy, e.g., where to aim and return spin, is based on simple heuristics. To achieve a level of competitive play comparable to that of other table tennis robots such as [28] or ranked human players, substantial research is required to develop more sophisticated and adaptive strategies.
