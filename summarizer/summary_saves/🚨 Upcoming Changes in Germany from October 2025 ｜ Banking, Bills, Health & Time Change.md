Myself and my wife Priya make videos all about Germany to make the expats life easier. If you are ready come let's get started. This video is sponsored by Vanakam Germany and if you are looking for a person learning Germany and worried how to handle it you can reach out to our team. With the rising euro I and a conversion rate this could be the right time to close either and existing loan in India or support your parents or even make a big purchase for your person right here in Germany. The conditions are simple you need to have a valid visa and not in a probation period and the best part is this person who can be able even if you are holding a blue card. We have tie up with multiple banks across Germany and you can we can fit you a best offer importantly the whole process is shoe for neutral and in English. You will find the application form link in the description. Change number one accounts and transfers and with that two important changes that affects all of us right from October. Who's impact most people or not even aware of? From October 1 from October 22 defined the transfers will become faster and safer for everyone because according to an a regulation from these first update account and transfers and with that two important changes that affect all of us right from October. Who's impact most people or not even aware of? From October 20 25 transfers will become faster and safer for everyone because according to an a regulation from then on all banks and Europe must enable instant transfer round the clock at no extra cost and without any amount limit. Whether you pay a bill at a weekend or transfer money at night it will arrive at the recipient in less than 10 seconds. Second one recipient verification is coming. While doing bank transfers to any person the system will automatically check if the recipients name matches their I ban you provide. In the past this verification did not happen and bank just look into the I ban and transfer the money. In future this will be more life saving if I ban a name matches you get a green light if there is a minor typo you get a yellow warning if the name and I ban don't match at all you get a red alert. If you ignore this and you are liable for any mistakes this affects sending and disillining money. For example if you receive your salary or pension the sender's name must match your bank records exactly or payments could be delayed or bounced back. So double check your payment details from October on to avoid covers on delays. In short the transfers will work faster from October but only if the name and account data exactly match. Anyone who checks your data now protects stem cell not only from errors but also from their fraud attempts. Second update is about a utility building. Some October 2020 find new rules will apply for heating cost billing in apartment. Buildings with central heat pumps. The current heat pump privilege which hallowed the flat rate or area based billing of electricity consumption will end at this point. In the future the actual consumption of each residential unit must be precisely measured and charged including the electricity cost for the operating the heat pump. For talents this means more transparency and a far distribution of the heating cost. Then lots of only until October 12 to defy to install the appropriate measuring device after that a flat rate allocation is no longer permitted. This new rule applies exclusive to central heat pumps decentralized systems in individual apartments or single family homes are not affected. Third update electronic parks in acting. Since April the introduction of the electronic parks in file EPA had already been underway. Many injured people now use it while other still view the digitization of their health insurance data not so welcoming. The new technology also repeatedly presents some kind of challenges in practices, pharmacies and clinic. But now it's certain. On September 30, 2025 the transition period ends and from October 12, 2025 all practices, hospitals and other service providers must use the EPA without exception. Important note you as insured can opt out of the EPA and actively decide against a digital record if you wish. But this objection must be made proactively. If you do nothing and electronic patient file will be set up for you or next update time change. The next one is the annual time change to winter time in October. This change happens in the night from Saturday to Sunday on October 26 at 3am. The clock goes back to 2am that means one more hour of sleep. At least theoretically because honestly I never really feel more rested after the change. Somehow it always makes me a bit more tired than before. So these were the few of the important changes awaiting us all in October 22, 2025. I wish you a successful month. Thanks for every thumbs up for this video and every subscriber on this channel. See you in one interesting video. Until then bye bye from Banakam Germany Balaji.
